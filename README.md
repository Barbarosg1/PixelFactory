How you built the community directly effects its performance regardless of how efficient and talented of its individual members. In
non-hierarchical open structures people tend to contribute more and become more creative. Faster communications and faster 
decision-making process helps of building effective and efficient teams. Traditionally, most companies were organized 
by managerial hierarchy in a slowly moving world. Today, many companies face challenges that ask for adaptability and creativity, 
like being innovative or adapting and creating new business models. Therefore, many companies have started to experiment with 
alternative organizational models and self-managed teams to make them more flexible, adaptable, agile, or whatever 
they call the trait that helps them to survive in rapidly changing environments. Most of these new 
models rely on circular structures without any hierarchy and power relationships. 
In circular structures every member of the community feels same responsibility for outputs of the group. 
Every member tries to contribute their best creating best possible value.

In this event we try to explain and simulate a basic difference around efficiency in between power hierarchies and 
open circular structures, namely sociocracy. We try to simulate that  hierarchical  models negatively affects employee
contributions and efficiency of the organization, though sociocracy type models helps on efficiency 
and faster decision making in today’s quite agile world. Sociocracy also creates an open environment that 
supports peer learning. Our Processing language application "Pixel Factory" simulates a production environment
under two different organizational structures, "hierarchical" and "sociocracy" based. We try to simulate 
that power based structures creates inefficiency and kills creativity. The purpose of the Pixel Factory  
to produce pixels to make a picture visible again which is initially blank. We see that under hierarchical world 
picture is being completed slower, and under sociocracy it is completed faster.

In this work I modeled and coded a production  environment both under hierarchal principals and under  
open sociocracy principals using Processing. In today’s world organizations are quite complex entities, 
facing considerable uncertainties in their operations and constantly interacting with their environment. 
Constant interaction with the environment requires less hierarchical organization to reach a better efficiency. 
Survival of an Open Organization is obtained through continuous interaction and adapting to the environment by 
learning and changing accordingly. Each member of the organization contributes their best. Communications and 
organizational practices coming from Open Source Software world , especially Scrum/Agile methodologies helps to 
develop a transferable models across industries as more people  begin to evangelize the idea of sociocracy, 
holacracy and other similar open organizational structures.
